# Lines starting with # or empty new lines are ignored
# First line defines [the highest frequency you can produce with whistling] [minimum frequency amplitude necessary to manipulate input]
# Every other line defines inputs automatically mapped to frequencies from your highest frequency to zero in descending order
# input definitions are read as follows:
# [what (input identifier)] [where (input device/action)] [how (how should the program behave when the corresponding frequency is detected)]
# what - for keyboard keys check https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#keyboard-keys
#      - for mouse buttons check https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mouse.html
#      - for mouse movements: 0 = right; 1 = up; 2 = left; 3 = down
# where - k = keyboard
#       - m = mouse movement
#       - c = mouse click
# how - p = press (key is pressed for as long as you maintain the frequency)
#     - c = click (key is pressed and immediately released only once for the entire duration of maintaining the frequency)
#     - t = toggle (acts like a switch, when the correct frequency is registered, flips the switch and then waits for the frequency to change)
# push to talk button is Enter (currently hardcoded)
